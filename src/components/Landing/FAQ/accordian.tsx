            Neurowolf is your personal AI workspace. It lets you create custom
            AI voice agents, chat with them in real time, and schedule meetings
            â€” all in one place. Everything happens in your private account.

          How do I get started with Neurowolf?
        </AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent className="flex flex-col gap-4 px-3">
          <p>
            Getting started is simple: sign up, log in, and create your first AI
            agent in minutes. From there, you can customize your agent, chat
            with it, and use it to organize and run meetings.

          Who can access my agents and meetings?

        <AccordionContent className="flex flex-col gap-4 px-3">
          <p>
            Only you. Neurowolf is a single-user platform, meaning only you can
            create agents, chat with them, and manage meetings. No one else has
            access unless you share the meeting link.
